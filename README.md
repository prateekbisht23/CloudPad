# CloudPad

**CloudPad** is a lightweight, real-time text and file-sharing platform inspired by Dontpad. It allows users to create unique URLs where they can instantly share text and files with others. Unlike traditional storage platforms, CloudPad is designed for quick, temporary sharing, with automatic deletion of inactive notes.

🚨 **Note:** CloudPad is now live! Real-time text sharing and file uploads are fully functional, with automatic expiration after 10 hours.
